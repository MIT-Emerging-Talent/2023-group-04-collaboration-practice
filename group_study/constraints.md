# Constraints
<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over. these may include:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
-->
- Questions should be defined about issues that data is present or could be collected on.
- Since the majority of us studied Python, the codes should be written in Python (no other languages).
- The problem the group will work on will be the problem the majority of group members vote for.
- Different time zones
- Holidays
- Skill diversity
- Availability
